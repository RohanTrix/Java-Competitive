# Breadth-First Search
Breadth-first search (BFS) visits the nodes of a graph in increasing order of their
distance from the starting node. Thus, we can calculate the distance from the starting
node to all other nodes using breadth-first search. However, breadth-first search is
more difficult to implement than depth-first search
