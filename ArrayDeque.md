# ArrayDeque
Resizable-array implementation of the `Deque` interface. Null elements are prohibited. This class is likely to be faster than Stack when used as a stack, and faster than LinkedList when used as a queue.

|  `StringBuilder(int initCapacity)`	 |     Creates an empty string builder with the specified initial capacity. |
|  `StringBuilder(String s)`	|  Creates a string builder whose value is initialized by the specified string, plus an extra 16 empty elements trailing the string. |
