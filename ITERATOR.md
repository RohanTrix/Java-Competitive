# ITERATOR
Iterators are used to cycle through or access all the elements of a collection in a particular order.

## STEPS TO USE AN ITERATOR:
---
1. Obtain an iterator to the start of the collection by calling collectionâ€™s `iterator()` method.
2. Set up a loop that makes a call to hasNext(). Have the loop iterate as long as `hasNext()`
returns `true`.
3. Within the loop, obtain each element by calling `next()`.

# THE COLLECTION INTERFACES
The Collection Classes implementing these interfaces have the functionality of these
interfaces. Therefore, these interfaces define the core behavior of a Collection class.

# THE COLLECTION ABSTRACT CLASSES
The Abstract Classes provide skeletal implementations that are used as starting points for
creating concrete Collections.

# THE COLLECTION CLASSES

These standard classes provide full implementation of the Collection that can be used as-is.

The below table shows various differences between the Collection classes. The terms used
in the table are -


|           Abbreviation     |         Meaning                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
|     AD       |    Allow Duplicates: It tells whether that particular collection allows duplicate values to be inserted.     |
|       AN       |     Allow Null: It tells whether null objects can be inserted into that particular collection.    |
|     Inserted Order         |   It tells whether the objects are stored in the same order in which they were inserted.      |
|  Sorted Order      |   It tells whether the objects are stored in sorted order.      |
| Synchronized    |  It tells whether the collection is thread-safe or not.   |
|       Random Access       |  It tells whether the collection has a get() method to returns the index of an object or return the object using an index.       |
|       Default capacity     |       The initial capacity of the collection when it is created using an empty constructor.  |
