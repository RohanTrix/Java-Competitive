# ITERATOR
Iterators are used to cycle through or access all the elements of a collection in a particular order.

## STEPS TO USE AN ITERATOR:
---
1. Obtain an iterator to the start of the collection by calling collectionâ€™s `iterator()` method.
2. Set up a loop that makes a call to hasNext(). Have the loop iterate as long as `hasNext()`
returns `true`.
3. Within the loop, obtain each element by calling `next()`.

# THE COLLECTION INTERFACES
The Collection Classes implementing these interfaces have the functionality of these
interfaces. Therefore, these interfaces define the core behavior of a Collection class.

# THE COLLECTION ABSTRACT CLASSES
The Abstract Classes provide skeletal implementations that are used as starting points for
creating concrete Collections.
